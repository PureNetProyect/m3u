Free legally receivable IPTV channels as .m3u for Kodi. :-)

The lists work fine with me in the IPTV Simple Client from Kodi. To automatically create the individual lists
to one list, i use the ADD-On IPTV-Merge from Matt Huisman. ;-) Without Kodi you can use the lists in the VLC-Media Player. :-)

You can also use the ZZ_PLAYLIST_ALL_TV.m3u, there you have all TV stations in one list (.m3u).

Important! Some TV-Stations (very few) only run under Kodi with the Youtube addon. ;-)

Should a channel stop working, just leave a message. :-)
